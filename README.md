# Sharing & publication policy
## Social media, livestreaming and demonstrations

Posting your own prompts and content to social media is generally permissible, as is live-streaming or demonstrating AI Products to others, as long as you:

Manually review each Output before sharing or while streaming;
Attribute the content to your name or your company;
Indicate that the content is AI-generated in a way no user could reasonably miss or misunderstand;
Do not share content that violates these terms, or that may offend others (including when you are taking audience requests for prompts).

##Content co-authored with AI Products

You may publish first-party written content (e.g., a book) created in part with AI Products under the following conditions:

The published content is attributed to your name or company;
The role of AI in formulating the content is clearly disclosed in a way that no reader could possibly miss, and that a typical reader would find sufficiently easy to understand;
The content does not violate our Acceptable Use Policy or these terms;
You refrain from sharing outputs that may offend others.
For instance, you must detail in a foreword or introduction (or some place similar) the relative roles of drafting, editing, etc between you and the AI Products. You should not represent AI-generated content as being wholly generated by you, and you must take ultimate responsibility for the content being published.
